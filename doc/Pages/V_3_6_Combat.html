    <ul>
        <li>the complete battle is lost</li>
        <li>loss of all earned money and gear??</li>
        <li>there might be further consequenses, f.e being kicked out from the tile</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After each wave:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the player might decide to leave without malus.The the batttle is still marked as failed</li>
        <li>health is not recoverd fully</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Wave</h2>
    <p>A wave is a setup of player and enemys.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>turn order is calculated by ??</li>
        <li>in a hold up, all the enemys get the first turn</li>
        <li>The player might decide to flee from combat. He will at least loose some money</li>

        <li>the wave is lost when the player runs out of HP</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>he might also finish the turn early.</li>
        <li>unspend AP might be automatically be consumed by defensive action, f.e. blocking an attack with a shield</li>
