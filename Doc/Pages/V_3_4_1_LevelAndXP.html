There is NO level and XP !

Reason: In common games the player levels up by defeating enemys and so on, gaining hitpoints, damage points and so on. He just needs to grind to be able to overpower stronger enemys. With each level its easier for him to defeat the once strong enemys and he skips to other locations with more powerful enemys. He isnt interested in the old enemys and locations because they cannot offer new challenges.

This game will follow another approach:
- if a quest is finished it might unlock a perk that upgrades the player stats
- a quest might of course also be related to defeating enemys, f.e. "defeat 5 ghostly creatures" leads to perk "ghostbuster" which improves combat skills against ghosts
- equipment and item use can change stats and add effects. To make it more difficult the modification should be balanced between advantage and disadvantage, f.e. "fireproof pants" increases fireresistance but also decreases speed.
- quests might also unlock enemy occurence in a location, f.e. after defeating Boss A, stronger enemys might occur in locations where previously only weak enemys occured or weak enemys learn some new tricks. By this we can spark players interest in already visited locations.
- morphstate can apply traits to the player
- combat moves might get unlocked depending on perks, equipment, traits aso

In general the game should start easy with few options to choose on ("simple sword attack" always hits but with little damage) and add more options that can result in better or worse result ("charge power attack" might fail if badly timed). By this the player is forced to experiment to get the best solution for every situation.
