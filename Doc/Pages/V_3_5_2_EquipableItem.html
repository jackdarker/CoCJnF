<body>
- items can be equipped in loadout slots
- the available slots depend on the player morphstate
- it might be disallowed to equip/unequip an item; a notification should be shown to the player describing the reason
- equipped items are still listed in the inventory because they still have weight

# Armor
- might get damaged in combat temporary (for a number of combat turns) or permanently
- can be repaired; how and level of repair is specific to the equipment, f.e. a simple leather armor can be repaired by the player but a mithril armor might require the service of a armor smith specialist

# Weapons
- similiar to Armor
- might unlock combat skills
