    <title>SceneSetup</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>A scene is created from components:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>ScenePersistance (done automatical by calling loadAdditive from ScenePersistance) </li>
    <li>UI prefab f.e. UI_Overworld</li>
    <li>the level data: models, background images, tiles,...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The starting scene of the game is ScenePersistance:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>has a FadeToBlack-Image that is used when switching scenes</li>
    <li>has a SceneController-Script that is used to swicth/load scenes</li>
    <li>has a Dataservice-Script that is used to load/save SaveGame</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Game-Scenes will be loaded additive and can therefore use the ScenePersistance components (SaveGame) to setup themself.</p>
