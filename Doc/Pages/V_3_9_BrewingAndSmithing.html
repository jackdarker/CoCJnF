    <h1>Brewing, Smithing</h1>
    <p>This feature is added later.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The player can create stuff from existing items</li>
        <li>For this he needs an IDEA like "I could make a leather armor"</li>
        <li>This idea might be refealed by talking to NPC,finding ingridients, reading books or other interactions.</li>
        <li>He might then start experimenting on the proper tool, f.e. a brewer</li>
        <li>He can select from multiple choice of what items to combine in what ratio.</li>
        <li>Experimenting has a chance to fail and consume the spend items. The chance depends on how close the ratio of the items matches the correct recipe, how many items he spends (up to a limit) his skill,a.s.o</li>
        <li>A succesful experiment doesnt mean the player knows how to safely produce the result again.</li>
        <li>But he might recover an RECIPE that increases successchance greatly, uncovers the correct combination or reduces the amount of materials to spend </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Assign the following Tag keywords to items so taht they can be found</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Alchemy:Recipe </li>
        <li>Alchemy:Ingridient </li>
        <li>Alchemy:Result </li>
        <li>Alchemy:Idea </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Add one of the following Tags to define the rareness of the item.</p>
    <p>Todo: this is a common item tag; how is % calculated?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Occurence:Ordinary >90%</li>
        <li>Occurence:VeryCommon >750%</li>
        <li>Occurence:Common >60%</li>
        <li>Occurence:Uncommon >40%</li>
        <li>Occurence:Rare >25%</li>
        <li>Occurence:VeryRare >10%</li>
        <li>Occurence:ExtremlyRare >1% </li>
    </ul>
