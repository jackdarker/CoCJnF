The player and maybe other NPC should be able to change their body structure, f.e. a human morphs to an anthro-wolf.

# MorphState
- For each possible body structure, the character keeps track of a morpstate ranging from 0 to 100%. F.e a morphstate for human, anthrowolf, feral wolf,...
- Each time the character is exposed to a morphing source, f.e. drinking a werwolf-potion, that morphstate is increased.
- If the morpstate reaches 100%, the character is morphed to this creature. After the morph all morphstates a set back to 0.
- their might be notifications to the player at certain levels, f.e. 25,50, 75% telling him that he should be aware of the changes.

TODO: It would be nice if the graphical representation could be changed (f.e. adding a tail at 50%) but thats out of reach???
- the morph and the notification occurs when resting (blackscreen).

TODO: Realtime morphing of the player model is to difficult?
- MorphBooster is an effect that amplifies the change of morphstate. Might apply only to certain morphstates. 
- MorphBlocker is an effect that supresses the change of morphstate. Might apply only to certain morphstates. 

# Traits
- A certain body structure might modify the base stats/Effect Multiplier of the character. F.e. a anthro-wolf can smell very good but has bad vision.
- the body structure might also enable/disable the equipping of items, f.e. a large minotaur cannot wear human armor.
