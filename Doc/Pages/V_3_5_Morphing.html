    <p>The player and maybe other NPC should be able to change their body structure, f.e. a human morphs to an anthro-wolf.</p>
    <h2>MorphState</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For each possible body structure, the character keeps track of a morpstate ranging from 0 to 100%. F.e a morphstate for human, anthrowolf, feral wolf,...</li>
        <li>Each time the character is exposed to a morphing source, f.e. drinking a werwolf-potion, that morphstate is increased over time</li>
<li>if no morphing effect is active, the morphstate is decreased over time slowly</li>
        <li>If the morpstate reaches 100%, the character is morphed to this creature. After the morph all morphstates a set back to 0.</li>
        <li>their might be notifications to the player at certain levels, f.e. 25,50, 75% telling him that he should be aware of the changes.</li>
        <li>TODO: It would be nice if the graphical representation could be changed (f.e. adding a tail at 50%) but thats out of reach???</li>
        <li>the morph and the notification occurs when resting (blackscreen).</li>
        <li>TODO: Realtime morphing of the player model is to difficult?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>MorphBooster/MorphBlocker</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>MorphBooster is an effect that amplifies the change of morphstate. Might apply only to certain morphstates.</li>
        <li>MorphBlocker is an effect that supresses the change of morphstate. Might apply only to certain morphstates.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Traits</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A certain body structure might modify the base stats/Effect Multiplier of the character. F.e. a anthro-wolf can smell very good but has bad vision.</li>
        <li>the body structure might also enable/disable the equipping of items, f.e. a large minotaur cannot wear human armor. </li>
    </ul>
