You can apply 1 or more Jobs.

A Jobs represents a profession f.e. Hunter, Armorsmith.

You level a Job by outfitting it and using connected skills f.e. Hunter - Archery.

If you unequipp a Job, you loose 30% of your xp to the next Job-Level. (To encourage the player not to switch jobs all the while).

Higher Job-Levels improve Skill-Levels and unlok special skills.
But the higher the Level, the fewer jobs you can equipp.
