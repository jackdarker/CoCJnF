# Perk Manager
- has a database of all Perks
- other game-functions request if a perk is unlocked (GetPerkLevel-Fct) and use this information for calculation

# Perks
- Perks are unlocked by fullfilling quest milestones
- Perks might have multiple level f.e. "BowSkill Lv1", Levels might be upgraded or downgraded (downgrade should only be done if the upgrade can be auired again, f.e. equiping/unequiping a gadget)
- Perks have a display flag
   - Hidden: the perk is not displayed in the stat-screen
   - RevealName: only the name is revealed
   - Full: also the description is revealed
- Perks can have negative effects (aka Quirks)

# Achievements 
- are like perks, but they are not used for calculation in the game
- they can unlock general game features, f.e. a gallery

# Support for Saving & Loading
- only the ID and Level of an unlocked perk is stored in player data
- state of Achievement is not stored in Playerdata but in AchievementState <<<TODO ????
