    <h1>  Capturing Creatures and Training</h1>
    <p>This feature is added later.</p>
    <h2>Capturing Creatures</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The player can capture creatures in BattleMode</li>
        <li>those creatures are handled like PersistantNPC</li>
        
        <li>more creature slots/housing might get unlocked while quests progress</li>
        <li>creatures can be sold; their price depends on their training level and rareness </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The process of capturing is like this:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the player has to find the creature and start a battle with capture mode on (selected before first round)</li>
        <li>capture mode reduces the damage to the creature and the creature might flee from combat</li>
        <li>some creatures might be uncapturable or untrainable, f.e. most NPCs</li>
        <li>he has to find a weak spot by unlocking the full "Sense"-Level or gathering information otherwise f.e. from a trainer</li>
        <li>he has to make use of the weak spot to drain the fatigue of the creature without damagin it to much</li>
        <li>the creature should also not be enraged</li>
        <li>when the creature is drained enough, the player might use some capture gear to bind it</li>
        <li>success chance depends on?? minigame??</li>
        <li>the gear might get damaged or destroyed on fail</li>
        <li>on success the creature is enraged but cannot fight properly, some fatigue is restored</li>
        <li>he needs to calm the creature before it can break; this can be done with potions or other things,</li>
        <li>if this fails the creature will break free, destroying the gear,  and flee </li>
        <li>after a successful calm, the creature is stored in inventory.This will highly increase the  burden</li>
        <li>there is a chance on every turn that the creature escapes unless it is put in a housing</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Housing Creatures</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>special housings might be needed in the players camp to store the creature, their space is limited</li>
        <li>the capture gear is refund</li>
        <li>the creature will decay if the player doesnt take care of it once in a while; f.e. reducing skill, starving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Training Creatures</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>to be able to use the creature in combat they need a basic training/ to be tamed</li>
        <li>there skill might further enhance with each combat and interation with the player</li>
        <li>training requires appropiate skilllevels for the trainer</li>
        <li>training is done with a minigame??</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Using Creatures</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>the player can take a creature with him if he has a free slot</li>
        <li>in some locations special events might be available if the player has a creature with him</li>
    </ul>
