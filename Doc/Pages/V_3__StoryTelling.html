    <h1> Story-Telling</h1>
    <p>Story-Telling, fe.
    <ul>
        <li>NPC Interaction</li>
        <li>story events</li>
    </ul>is done in visiual novel like style similiar to renpy.
</p>
    <p>Example scenario:
    <ul>
        <li>(A) You meet a wise man that could give you some information. But a bunch of grunts stole his googles that he needs to decypher his scrolls. This starts a quest 
            QuestWiseMansGoogles</li>
        <li>(B) After finding the grunt's hideout you have the option to fight them, steal the googles back or persuade them to hand them over.</li>
        <li>(C) You bring the googles back to the wise man and earn his gratitude.</li>
        <li>(D) Depending on other occurences, additional dialog themes might get unlocked, </li>

    </ul>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>use a generic asset/scene for dialog</li>
        <li>trigger the asset and point it to getThemesForDialog(ThemeID). ThemeID is an 
        Identifier for the concrete dialogScene f.e. SceneWiseMan</li>
        <li>quest/storys/Chatter.. register themself to the DialogMgr:&nbsp; 
            RegisterDialogForQuest(ThemeID, QuestID)</li>
        <li>getThemesForDialog fetches the actual quests/character relation/... related to 
            ThemeID and triggers getDialog(ThemeID) to build a combined DialogTree</li>
        <li>depending on pc choice/calculation: navigate through the dailogtree and switch state of the actual dialog-theme</li>
        <li>the dialog might be terminated and switch back to the previous scene 
            (exploration,...) or call a new scene (combat, trading,...). </li>

    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2> Visual novel functions</h2>
    <p>
        The visual novel asset implements<ul>

    <p>
        No undo functionality except for testing purpose?</p>
    <p>
        No save/load while in dialog?</p>
    <h2> Data</h2>
    <p>Where is the story data stored?</p>
    <h3>DialogTreeBuilder</h3>
    <p>A database that checks witch DialogTrees are applicable for the ThemeID. It 
        therefore iterates over all registered DialogEntrys and returns an initial 
        DialogTree.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>DialogTree</h3>
    <p>An object that represents the actual state of the dialog </p>
    <p>getDialog() -&gt; DialogSet: returns an DialogSet containing information for the 
        text &amp; pictures to display, animations to play, settings for fade in/out, 
        choices</p>
    <p>continueDialog(choiceID) -&gt; result: triggers the creation of the next DialogSet; 
        result might be &quot;continue dialog&quot;, &quot;exit dialog&quot;, &quot;exit dialog and switch scene&quot; </p>
