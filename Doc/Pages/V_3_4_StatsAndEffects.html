- each creature has BaseStats
- depending on theire equipment, perks, active effects those are recalculated to EffectiveStats
- they have a collection of EffectMultiplier

# EffectMultiplier
- the multiplier is used to recalulate the poer of an effect f.e.

   weakness to freeze 20% => scale freeze resistance by 80%

   resistance to fire 100% => scale fire resistance by 200%
- perks and equipment can modify the Multiplier or create it
- the total multiplier is calculated by adding all specific multipliers; Each specific multiplier has a minimum/maximum threshold to limit the range of the possible total multiplier f.e. (notice that the order is descending multiplier)

    fireproof breastplate    50%  min=0%  max=70%    => +50%

    potion of fireresistance 20%  min=0%  max=65%    => +65%  ( not 70% because max)

    fireproof helmet         15%  min=0%  max=70%    => +70%  ( not 80% because max) 

    base multiplier          0%  min=-100%  max=100% => **+70% **
