        <li>&nbsp;each creature has BaseStats </li>
        <li>depending on theire equipment, perks, active effects those are recalculated to EffectiveStats
        </li>
        <li>they have a collection of EffectMultiplier </li>

    <h2>
        EffectMultiplier
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>&nbsp;the multiplier is used to recalulate the poer of an effect f.e.

   weakness to freeze 20% => scale freeze resistance by 80%

   resistance to fire 100% => scale fire resistance by 200%
</li>
        <li>perks and equipment can modify the Multiplier or create it
</li>
        <li>the total multiplier is calculated by adding all specific multipliers; Each specific multiplier has a minimum/maximum threshold to limit the range of the possible total multiplier f.e. (notice that the order is descending multiplier)

            <ul>
                <li>fireproof breastplate    50%  min=0%  max=70%    => +50%

    </li>
                <li>potion of fireresistance 20%  min=0%  max=65%    => +65%  ( not 70% because max)

                </li>
                <li>fireproof helmet         15%  min=0%  max=70%    => +70%  ( not 80% because max) 

                </li>
                <li>base multiplier          0%  min=-100%  max=100% => **+70% ** </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
