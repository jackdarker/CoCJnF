# Questmanager
- has a database of all available quests
- after each turn, it runs the UpdateState-Fct of all Quests to check if a Queststate changed
- if a Queststate changed, it will collect the player notification (if there is any) and display it to the player one after another.

# Quest
- has a questID to be able to find it in the database
- consists of minimum 2 milestones: start and end
- has a unique name
- has a Display-flag: 

   * Hidden: the quest is completely hidden to the user (also milestones)
   * All: the Name is revealed; milestone display depends on milestone

- has a State-flag to store a quest related value: unsigned int32 <<<< or variant ??
This should only be used if its necessary to store history information f.e. which milestone branch the player choosed.
This value can then be checked by the milestone.

# Milestone
- has name and description
- has a UpdateState-Fct that is called if milestone condition is fullfilled
- the milestone might branch to different milestones depending on which condition is fullfilled (aka Quest tree), it might also point to itself for re-doable quests 
- has a GetPlayerNotification-Fct to output the state of the fullfillment, f.e. "You successfully ollected 5 potions." or "You need to collect 5 potions."
- has a Display-flag: 

   * Hidden: the milestone name and condition requirement is displayed as "???" (if at least the quest is visible)
   * RevealName: name and description are revealed, condition requirement not displayed
   * All: all is displayed, also the condition requirements for the next milestone

- has a State-flag:

   * Running: Condition not fullfilled
   * Done: milestone completed
- if the milestone is completed (once set to Done), it might unlock a perk or do other things

# Save-Load-support
- Only the Quest-flags and current Milestone-flags are stored
