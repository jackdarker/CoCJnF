# Inventory
- the player can carry unlimited items, there is no restriction in inventory-slots
- the player has a burden threshold, different effects may be applied if the total carried mass is near/above the treshold, f.e. 
   burden >100% decrease fatigue & speed & overall resistance & overall damage by 30%
   burden >200% ... decrease fatigue & speed by 90%

# Items
- normal items have a weight (in kg)
- the same item 

# Quest-Items
Quest items are different from normal items:
- they have no weight
- they cannot be dropped by the player, they can only be removed by quest milestones
- they might be used/equipped by the user but this might also be locked, f.e. forcing a collar on the player - the collar might not be removed by the player
- they should not be consumed/destroyed, f.e. an armor, potion 

Please note that some quest might explicitly use normal items, f.e. "You have to carry this heavy stone to your camp" doesnt make much sense if the stone has no weight and is not burdening you.
