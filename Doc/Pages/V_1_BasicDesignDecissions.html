    * 3D is used instead 2D sprites because we can use exisiting models and anymation (Im not an artist)
    * non-photorealistic graphic - using a toonshader because it reduces necessary complexity of 3D design
    * turn based, maybe with quick time events?
    * no multiplayer
    * actually only targeting windows platform & WebGL
