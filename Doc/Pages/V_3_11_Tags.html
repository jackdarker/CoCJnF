Imagine the following:
        </p>
    <p>- you write a quest milestone that should react whenever the player wears some sort of health potion in its inventory like:
<br />if(player.inventory.HasItemOfClass(SmallHealthPotion)) {
<br />    player.SendNotification("You have an health potion in your inventory");
<br />}
<br />- Now someone adds an item "BetterHealthPotion". You would have to change your code to:
<br />if(player.inventory.HasItemOfClass(SmallHealthPotion) ||
<br />  player.inventory.HasItemOfClass(BetterHealthPotion)) {
<br />    player.SendNotification("You have an health potion in your inventory");
<br />}
- That would lead to a lot of coupling and maintenance</p>
<br /><p>To bypass this a Tags are used:
<br />- Each object can have 0 to n Tags assigned , f.e. "BetterHealthPotion" has Tag {Potion:RestoreHealth}
<br />- other objects can query the objects Tags or can filter lists of objects by Tags. Only the baseObject of the object is needed for this.
<br />- the code would now look like this:
<br />if(player.inventory.HasItemWithTag(Potion:RestoreHealth)) {
<br />    player.SendNotification("You have an health potion in your inventory");
<br />}</p>
<p># Tags
<br />- Game.GameObjectBase is the Parent class of all Items, perks, Quests and so on. It has functions to maintain the associated tags:
<br />- addTag
<br />- removeTag
<br />- removeAllTags
<br />- hasTag
<br />- hasAllTags
<br />- hasAnyTags
<br />- Child-Objects can modify their tags
<br />- Other objects can access the tags because they only need to refer to Game.GameObjectBase - no coupling to specifi objects
<br />- a Tag consists of a sector and form f.e. Species:Fox => Sector=Species & Form=Fox
<br />- Tags might relate to each other, f.e. Species:Fox and Species:Wolf relate to Species:Canine.
</p><p>
# Tag-database
<br />- this database contains all Tags and their relation
<br />- the difficult thing is to define available Tags and their relation. A change here can cause a lot of changes in other classes !
<br />- TODO: Please see the Tag-List for a listing of all Tags
