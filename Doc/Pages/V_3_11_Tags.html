Imagine the following:
- you write a quest milestone that should react whenever the player wears some sort of health potion in its inventory like:
`if(player.inventory.HasItemOfClass(SmallHealthPotion)) {

    player.SendNotification("You have an health potion in your inventory");
}`
- Now someone adds an item "BetterHealthPotion". You would have to change your code to:
`if(player.inventory.HasItemOfClass(SmallHealthPotion) ||

  player.inventory.HasItemOfClass(BetterHealthPotion)) {

    player.SendNotification("You have an health potion in your inventory");
}`
- That would lead to a lot of coupling and maintenance

To bypass this a Tags are used:
- Each object can have 0 to n Tags assigned , f.e. "BetterHealthPotion" has Tag {Potion:RestoreHealth}
- other objects can query the objects Tags or can filter lists of objects by Tags. Only the baseObject of the object is needed for this.
- the code would now look like this:

`if(player.inventory.HasItemWithTag(Potion:RestoreHealth)) {

    player.SendNotification("You have an health potion in your inventory");
}`
# Tags
- Game.GameObjectBase is the Parent class of all Items, perks, Quests and so on. It has functions to maintain the associated tags:
- addTag
- removeTag
- removeAllTags
- hasTag
- hasAllTags
- hasAnyTags
- Child-Objects can modify their tags
- Other objects can access the tags because they only need to refer to Game.GameObjectBase - no coupling to specifi objects
- a Tag consists of a sector and form f.e. Species:Fox => Sector=Species & Form=Fox
- Tags might relate to each other, f.e. Species:Fox and Species:Wolf relate to Species:Canine.

# Tag-database

- this database contains all Tags and their relation
- the difficult thing is to define available Tags and their relation. A change here can cause a lot of changes in other classes !
- TODO: Please see the Tag-List for a listing of all Tags
