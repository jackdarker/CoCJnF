    <h1> Navigation in Overworld</h1>
    <p>The player might navigate from tile to tile.</p>
    <p>Before leaving a tile:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Under certain conditions a check might be done before leaving the area, giving the user a choice to stay or continue. F.e. reminding him that he has still optional quest targets when leaving a quest area.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When entering a tile:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The player might need to pass several checks if he can enter the tile, f.e. if he has a certain key or gadget. If not he gets a notification and remains on the old tile.</li>
        <li>Entering a tile might trigger a conditional battle or has a high chance to trigger a random battle. If the player gets defeated, he is remains on the old tile. </li>

    </ul>
    <h2> Fast travel</h2>
    <p>No fasttravel: Fast travel could break quests by bypassing tiles with quest triggers.</p>
